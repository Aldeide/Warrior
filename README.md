# Warrior

A simulation tool for warriors in WOTLK Classic that is available [here](https://aldeide.github.io/Warrior/).

This is mainly inspired by Guybrush's excellent [WarriorSim](https://guybrushgit.github.io/WarriorSim/) that was available for the world of warcraft classic era.

I'm by no means a professional programmer and, as such, feedback and ideas for improvement are always welcome.

# Current State

This simulation tool in its current state is mostly functional. What remains to be done, among other things:

* Implement engineering enchantments.
* Handle Arms cycle better.
* Complete gems lists.
* Add gem / items filtering based on phase and / or source.
* Implement item sets.
* Add items to the list of available equipment. Blizzard has mentioned some potential changes to itemization, so I'd like to know more before investing time.
* Add the possibility to simulate all items for a given slot.
* Make it much, much more faster. Unfortunately there are some limitations in my choice of technology (blazor webasm).
* Tackle various, still unknown, issues.
