# Warrior

A simulation tool for warriors in WOTLK Classic.

# Current State

This simulation tool in its current state is mostly functional. What remains to be done, among other things:

* Implement engineering enchantments.
* Implement item sets.
* Add items to the list of available equipment. Blizzard has mentioned some potential changes to itemization, so I'd like to know more before investing time.
